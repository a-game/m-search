 {"id":"tt1714917","title":"Gimme Danger","overview":"No other band in rock'n'roll history has rivaled The Stooges' combination of heavy primal throb, spiked psychedelia, blues-a-billy grind, complete with succinct angst-ridden lyrics, and a snarling, preening leopard of a frontman who somehow embodies Nijinsky, Bruce Lee, Harpo Marx, and Arthur Rimbaud all rolled into one. There is no precedent for The Stooges, while those inspired by them are now legion.  The film will present the context of their emergence musically, culturally, politically, historically, and relate their adventures and misadventures while charting their inspirations and the reasons behind their initial commercial challenges, as well as their long-lasting legacy.","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/a/H/f/T/aHfTr5dknfXEh3jzvyopbWsBhM2.jpg","runtime":108,"popularity":7.455,"genres":["Music", "Documentary"],"released":"2016-10-28"}, 
 {"id":"tt1715210","title":"Time of EVE: The Movie","overview":"In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. However, treating androids on the same level as humans is frowned upon, and there is constant paranoia surrounding the possibility of robots defying humans, their masters. Those who appear too trustworthy of their androids are chided and labeled as \"android-holics\". Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, \"Are you enjoying the time of EVE?\". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, traces Sammy's movements and finds an unusual café. Nagi, the barista, informs them that the café's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. While Rikuo tries to reveal Sammy's intentions, he begins to question the legitimacy of the fear that drives humans to regard androids as nothing more than mere tools.","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/k/r/5/W/kr5WBI8XF266hVNu9nT2wQwPg0J.jpg","runtime":106,"popularity":14.389,"genres":["Animation", "Science Fiction", "Drama"],"released":"2010-03-06"},
