He describes his astonishment that, at the start of the 21st century, religious faith is gaining ground in the face of rational, scientific truth. Science, based on scepticism, investigation and evidence, must continuously test its own concepts and claims. Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction. The growth of extreme fundamentalism in so many religions across the world not only endangers humanity but, he argues, is in conflict with the trend over thousands of years of history for humanity to progress to become more enlightened and more tolerant.","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/g/O/w/0/gOw03UkPXB7klc9XLsqFdP2Dvyj.jpg","runtime":93,"popularity":5.566,"genres":["Documentary"],"released":"2006-01-09"},

 {"id":"tt0994794","title":"Shakugan no Shana: The Movie","overview":"The movie is more or less a retelling of the first few episodes of the series that is not much more than a slightly padded director's cut. You do learn some interesting details such as where Yugi's dad is, a look at the flame haze who was in the city before Shana, and even a couple of new powers for the Reiji Maigo. The story is certainly fleshed out quite a bit more and the final 15 minutes of the film comprise a surprisingly powerful conclusion (worth the price of admission on its own), but I would have liked a more original story rather then a highly polished version of one that I've already enjoyed. In the end, spectacular visuals, great new music, and well thought out additions to the core story leave you feeling glad to have seen the film. On the other hand, the fact that anything new that was added obviously doesn't change the events that come later in the series means that established fans will likely leave the experience less than satisfied.","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/f/M/R/s/fMRs3Km9gcjVWt9WCujO5E3FPUO.jpg","runtime":96,"popularity":8.851,"genres":["Animation"],"released":"2007-04-21"},
