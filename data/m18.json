Like the Prodigal story, Heart of the Country is a tale of a father’s unconditional love.  He simply wants a relationship with his children, and once that relationship is restored, he begins to create healing for his broken daughter.  Her marriage has to be rebuilt, her belief in herself, and her peace with her mother’s death all come together through the quiet, selfless guidance of her loving father.  The novel, written by Rene Gutteridge from the original screenplay by filmmaker John Ward, takes us from the glamour of Manhattan to the open beauty of the fields of rural Columbus County, North Carolina as the timeless tale of the Prodigal Son is reborn!","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/i/s/g/P/isgPGUz3zc1qDkugEKDj0TcwNZs.jpg","runtime":87,"popularity":5.389,"genres":["Drama", "Romance"],"released":"2013-08-19"},
