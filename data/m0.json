[{"id":"tt0000010","title":"Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory","overview":"Working men and women leave through the main gate of the Lumière factory in Lyon, France. Filmed on 22 March 1895, it is often referred to as the first real motion picture ever made, although Louis Le Prince's 1888 Roundhay Garden Scene pre-dated it by seven years.  Three separate versions of this film exist, which differ from one another in numerous ways. The first version features a carriage drawn by one horse, while in the second version the carriage is drawn by two horses, and there is no carriage at all in the third version. The clothing style is also different between the three versions, demonstrating the different seasons in which each was filmed. This film was made in the 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and at a speed of 16 frames per second. At that rate, the 17 meters of film length provided a duration of 46 seconds, holding a total of 800 frames.","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/c/T/2/s/cT2sefAXgEoICJUCEM6UfxXfuDM.jpg","runtime":1,"popularity":5.802,"genres":["Documentary"],"released":"1895-03-22"},

 {"id":"tt0000091","title":"The Haunted Castle","overview":"Le Manoir du diable or The House of the Devil, released in the United States as The Haunted Castle and in Britain as The Devil's Castle, is an 1896 French short silent film directed by Georges Méliès. The film tells the story of an encounter with the Devil and various attendant phantoms. It is intended to evoke amusement and wonder from its audiences, rather than fear. However, because of its themes and characters, it has been considered to technically be the first horror film, as well as potentially the first vampire film.  The film opens with a large bat flying into a medieval castle, circling a room, and then suddenly changing into the Devil. Producing a cauldron, Mephistopheles conjures up a young girl and various supernatural creatures in an effort to scare two cavaliers, eventually succeeding in causing one to flee. Ultimately the remaining cavalier is confronted face-to-face by the Devil before reaching for and brandishing a large crucifix, which causes the Devil to vanish.","poster":"https://assets.movies.skruv.io/o/6/1/c/o61cxCGlLdPxzv7BPYitmbDfaeA.jpg","runtime":3,"popularity":5.468,"genres":["Fantasy", "Horror"],"released":"1896-12-24"},
